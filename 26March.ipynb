    "Simple Linear Regression:\n",
    "Simple linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between two variables: a dependent variable and an independent variable. It assumes a linear relationship between the variables, meaning that the change in the dependent variable can be explained by a constant slope multiplied by the independent variable, plus an error term.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "    Let's consider a simple example where we want to predict a person's weight (dependent variable) based on their height (independent variable). We collect data from a sample of individuals, measuring their heights and corresponding weights. By applying simple linear regression to this data, we can determine the linear relationship between height and weight, estimating the slope and intercept of the regression line. \n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple Linear Regression:\n",
    "Multiple linear regression extends the concept of simple linear regression by incorporating multiple independent variables to predict the dependent variable. Instead of just one independent variable, multiple linear regression considers a linear combination of several independent variables to model their collective impact on the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "    Let's expand on the previous example by including additional independent variables to predict a person's weight. Now, in addition to height, we also consider variables like age, gender, and body fat percentage. By applying multiple linear regression to the dataset containing these variables, we can estimate the coefficients for each independent variable, representing their respective impact on the dependent variable (weight).\n"

    "Linear regression relies on several assumptions to ensure the validity and reliability of the model. These assumptions are as follows:\n",
    "    \n",
    "1.Linearity: The relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable is assumed to be linear. This means that the change in the dependent variable is a constant multiple of the change in the independent variables. To check this assumption, you can create scatter plots of the variables and visually inspect if they exhibit a linear pattern. \n",
    "2.Independence: The observations in the dataset are assumed to be independent of each other. This means that there is no correlation or dependence between the residuals (the differences between the predicted and observed values) of the model.\n",
    "3.Normality: The residuals follow a normal distribution with a mean of zero. This assumption is important for hypothesis testing and constructing confidence intervals. You can examine the normality assumption by creating a histogram or a Q-Q plot of the residuals and checking if they approximate a bell-shaped curve.\n"
