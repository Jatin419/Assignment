    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "High Accuracy: Random Forest Regressor generally provides high accuracy in both regression and classification tasks.\n",
    "Robustness to Overfitting: As discussed earlier, the combination of bootstrapping, random feature selection, and ensemble averaging reduces the risk of overfitting, making the model more reliable on unseen data.\n",
    "Handles Non-linear Relationships: Random Forest Regressor can capture complex non-linear relationships between features and the target variable, making it suitable for a wide range of real-world problems.\n",
    "Outlier Robustness: The averaging process in Random Forest Regressor makes it less sensitive to outliers in the data compared to individual decision trees.\n",
    "Reduced Bias: The ensemble of trees helps to reduce the model's bias and makes it less prone to underfitting compared to a single decision tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages\n",
    "Black Box Nature: Interpretability can be a challenge with Random Forest Regressor due to its complex nature. \n",
    "Memory and Computational Cost: The Random Forest Regressor can be memory-intensive, especially when dealing with a large number of trees and features. \n",
    "Hyperparameter Tuning: Random Forest Regressor has several hyperparameters that require tuning to optimize its performance.\n",
    "Extrapolation Issues: Random Forest Regressor may not perform well on extrapolation beyond the range of the training data, as it tends to interpolate rather than extrapolate.\n"
