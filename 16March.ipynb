    "Overfitting refers to a situation where a machine learning model performs extremely well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consequences of overfitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "Poor generalization: The model fails to generalize to unseen data, resulting in low accuracy and poor performance in real-world scenarios.\n",
    "High variance: Small changes in the training data can lead to significant fluctuations in the model's predictions, making it less reliable.\n",
    "Loss of interpretability: Overfit models are often overly complex and harder to interpret, making it challenging to understand the reasons behind their predictions.\n",

    "Mitigation of overfitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-validation: Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance on different subsets of the data, which can give a more realistic estimate of its generalization performance.\n",
    "Regularization: Introduce regularization techniques like L1 (Lasso) or L2 (Ridge) regularization, which add penalty terms to the model's loss function to discourage overly complex models.\n",
